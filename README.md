📘 JavaScript Console Quiz Game (HTML + JS Version)
This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs using prompt() and alert(), but is triggered through an HTML button instead of starting automatically. It demonstrates the use of core JavaScript concepts such as arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, input handling, and external JS linking.

🚀 Features
Quiz runs inside browser prompts and alerts

Triggered by clicking a Start Quiz button in index.html

Case-insensitive and space-trimmed input checking

Score tracking throughout the quiz

Clean separation of HTML and JavaScript (external JS file)

Organized data using an array of question–answer objects
